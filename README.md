#GoloHttpServer

To learn Golo language, I decided to write a simple Http server.
It can be used to serve static HTML pages

##What?

- the server will listen to local port 5000
- Html pages must be in the same folder as GoloHttpServer.golo
- you can use subfolders (if not, it's a bug ;) )

like K33g_org says:
*have fun.*
